Successor to [`dbview.php`](https://github.com/aaviator42/dbview.php).


Configure `DBDIR` and `DBEXT` at the top of od `dbview2.php`. Now you'll be able to view the contents of any StorX DB file in `DBDIR` in a browser. Obviously, don't use in production.  
Supports class definitions so you can properly view contents of corresponding objects.
